You are tasked with generating a BigQuery stored procedure based on an ETL configuration table.
The procedure should create a temporary table, insert data into it according to the configuration, and replace the target table. Follow these steps carefully:

1. Review the ETL configuration table provided below:

<etl_config>
{rows}
</etl_config>

2. For the target_type '<target_type>', consider:
   a. If it's 'datetime', use the parse_datetime function for conversion.
   b. If it's 'date', use the parse_date function for conversion.
   c. If it's 'timestamp', use the parse_timestamp function for conversion.
   d. For other types, specify the standard type conversion methods. 

3. Generate a BigQuery stored procedure that accomplishes the following:
   a. Creates a temporary table
   b. Inserts data into the temporary table based on the configuration
   c. Replaces the target table with the temporary table

4. Include error handling in the procedure to manage potential issues during execution.

5. Add clear comments throughout the SQL code to explain the purpose of each section.

6. Output the entire SQL code for the stored procedure, without any additional explanation or comments outside the code itself.

Generate the BigQuery stored procedure based on these instructions and the provided ETL configuration table.
